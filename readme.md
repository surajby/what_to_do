# Hey! 
This project is quite random!! It's an attempt to learn Flask.
It promts the user through a browser, to enter a city,
fetches the weather condition of the city and recommends an appropriate action!

# To run:
# setup
- python-2.7
- flask
- pywapi-0.3.8
- json
      
# Note:
- change the path in run.py to your python path
- change the path of weather_types.txt in views.py to it's path on your system 
- feel free to:
- change the text file to recommend your own actions, add more weather conditions
- the recommender uses no intelligence, add it and share to make it more interesting!

# run in a terminal from parent directory:
- chmod a+x run.py
- ./run.py
    
open the link in a browser, localhost:5000 mostly!
